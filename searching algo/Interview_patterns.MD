# Common Interview Patterns :    
*  Apply binary search : Look for monotonic sequences like strictly increasing or decreasing / sorted order.   
*  Look for exact range (maybe infinite), find start value and end value.
*  If it looks like sorted series like start = 10, end = 30, and we can try every possible value from 10...11...12...13.........30, then we need to apply binary 
search to optimize it as this series is itself sorted. This is also called modified binary search pattern.
