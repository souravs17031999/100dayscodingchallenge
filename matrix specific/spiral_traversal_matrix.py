# Program for printing the matrix in spiral form , that means one by one square loops going one by one inside one of each other
# IDEA: logic is very simple, we need to set four boundaries so that we can print one by one all of the four sides of the square loop for each loops
# for that we set : k, l, m, n -> where k is used to set boundary for first row (from left to right),
# n is used to set last column boundary (from top to bottom), m is used to set boundary for last row (from right to left), l is used to set
# boundary for first column (from bottom to top)
# In this way we go from first row -> last column -> last row -> first column in clockwise direction (spiral way)
# Now, going for innner loops, from observation we can see that , k -> incremented, n-> decremented, m -> decremented, l-> incremented
# TIME : 0(M*N) WHERE M, N -> ROWS, COLUMNS AND SPACE : 0(1)
# WE CAN VISUALIZE THE ALGORITHM AS SHOWN BELOW USING FOUR POINTERS : 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# TOP ->  [1, 2, 3, 4]
#         [5, 6, 7, 8]
#         [9, 2, 4, 1]
# BOTTOM->[5, 4, 1, 1]
#          ^        ^
#         LEFT     RIGHT    
#
# TOP TO BOTTOM => CONTROLS ROWS
# LEFT TO RIGHT => CONTROLS COLS
# SO, LET'S SAY WE PRINT FIRST ROW, SO, WE RUN LOOP FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, AND SINCE TOP SHOULD BE CONSTANT, THEN PRINT A[TOP][COL], COL IS GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.
# SIMILARY, FOR OTHER THREE SEGMENTS, LAST COL, LAST ROW, THEN FINALLY FIRST ROW.
# ALTERNATE WAY :  WE CAN RUN THE ABOVE LOGIC USING "DIR" VARIABLE WHICH CAN INCREMENT EVERY TIME WE RUN INSIDE WHILE LOOP, DIR = (DIR + 1) % 4
# WHICH WILL BE CYCLIC AS WE WANT, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3... AND ASSOCIATE ALL FOUR NUMBERS WITH RESPECTIVE ORDERING OR DIRECTION.

# Anti-spiral traversal
# We can observe that anti-spiral print is exactly opposite print of spiral
# So, we can use stacks for storing all the elements and then, pop out one by one and print all the elements.
