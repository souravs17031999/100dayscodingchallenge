# program to find unique number in a array where every element is repeated thrice except one
# IDEA: Naive solution is to use sorting and check which one is non repeating, then one optimized time solution is
# to use hashing and keep counter for
# occurences and check whose count is only "1".
# Most efficient logic is to observe that the numbers will be either of form 3N or 3N + 1 and that means if converted to binary , then also
# the bits will be in the either of the two form.
# Now, we can extract one by one bits and take sum of those bits and store in a separate array of max size 64 bits, and since
# these sums are also of the form 3N or 3N + 1 , when we will take modulus of 3 , then one that unique number will give remainder "1" (3N + 1)
# and all others will be "0" (3N form).
# The final remainder of the modulus in the array will be the number when converted to decimal.
# TIME : 0(N), SPACE : 0(1)

# If we will convert all numbers into decimal form, then we will observe that all the numbers will be having either 3N or 3N + 1 form, and when we sum up all the bits (set)
# at every pos, and then fill in count[64], we will getting the required number.
# Wherever, sum will be 3N => bit will be 0, and wherever it will of 3N+1, it will be 1.
# Bits which will be set in 3N number, will be now set in 3N + 1, which will then be set in 3N + 2 form number, so it goes in cyclic way.
# After writing all numbers and verifying the above property, we will be able to proof that only 3N+1, will be having set bits others not.

# Mathematical Equation = ( 3*(a+b+c+d) – (a + a + a + b + b + b + c + c + c + d) ) / 2
# Mathematical Equation = ( 3*(a+b+c+d) – (a + a + a + b + b + b + c + c + c + d) ) / 2
# CODE : Mathematical Equation = ( 3*(a+b+c+d) – (a + a + a + b + b + b + c + c + c + d) ) / 2
