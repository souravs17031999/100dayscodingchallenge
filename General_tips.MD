## For solving problems :   

* First match the pattern of similar questions solved in the past (run through all the DS/ALGO interview patterns)  
* If above doesn't works, then it means the question may involve some thinking beyond any similar pattern : Go for explicilty writing input-output examples and clearly observe any
pattern hidden in it, usually it does help to write the input and output examples explicitly and correlate it.   
There are tricky patterns hidden inside the problem which are only visible when written clearly explicitly.  

## General tips : 

* Listen to question completely and carefully, then ask clarifying questions and observe input and output examples.   
* Start from basic naive solution, and then move upto optimal solution one by one.    
* Discuss the time and space tradeoffs for all the solutions.   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
* Always have a positive smile and confidence while speaking during the interview.      
* If interviewer interrupts, then allow him to speak completely, then only tell your opinion (don't speak over him)
* Have a two way dialogue and discussion.   
* Think of interviewer as a friend/colleague.

REMEMBER INTERVIEW IS JUST SIMULATION OF REAL TIME PROBLEM SOLVING WITH YOUR COLLEAGUE IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY WORKING AT COMPANY AND SOLVING PROBLEM FOR THE CLIENT.
