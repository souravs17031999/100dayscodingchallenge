# Program to compute sqrt efficiently using binary search in 0(lg(N)) where N is number.
# We use same concept of monotonicity and finding search space, so here also we know our bounds, the answer will lie between 0 - N, or more strictly,
# 0 - sqrt(N)
# So, we can set it our bounds and this all possibilities insider this range is already in sorted order, we use binary search to compute and check for every
# number if there is possibility of square that is perfect and return it or whatever the nearest number is.

# For some precision , for real numbers, we can also newton-raphson's method for computing it using iterative algorithm to converge
# newton's raphson method is derived from drawing a ling as a tangent to the function f(x) at x = xi, then xi + 1 is the point at which this tangent cuts
# at x-axis
# formula by newton-raphson method : x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x)/f'(x) which gives next iterative value and this goes on until desired precision is acheived
# deriving for f(x) = 0, so f(x) = x^2 - n for given number n which will be used to compute square root of n.
# putting f(x) for sqrt in the above formula will yield,
# x(n+1) = (x(n) + (n/x(n))) / 2
# This takes much lesser time than 0(lg(N))
