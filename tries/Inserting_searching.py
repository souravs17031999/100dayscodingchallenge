# Tries are really efficient for string range queries
# Let's suppose we have records :
# ['Tea', 'slice', 'tree', 'poker', 'thapar'....]
# searching for some strings => "to", "Tea" etc....
# Hashing is an important idea which can be efficient, there is a tradeoffs between
# time and space for small records and large records.
# We will use idea of HashMaps to Create Tries where each node contains HashMaps which maps
# chars (the children of current root) to their corresponding Node.
# This will help in searching efficiently, as we are just going to search long down the tree.
# TIME for serching will be at best 0(M), M is length of string.

# So, every node has its own hashtable which contains keys as the char it holds, and the
# nodes address it points to.
# So, it can be seen that while searching is faster for set of larger records as there is no
# scope for hash collisions, or computing time for hashing is not required, but one of the cons
# of using Trie is higher space requirements (as we are storing each char in separate node)
# unlike hash which generally allocates whole chunk to the complete key instead of char by char.

# FOR WORDS LIKE "THE", "A", "THERE".....
#     ROOT
#     |  |
#     T  A
#     H
#     E
#      R
#      E
#
# If only the queries are needed, then we have shown here, HashTables using dict in python.
# BUT IF ANYWHERE ORdering is also important, then we need to keep a List names as
# CHILDREN[MAX] , where MAX will be 26 if considering only lower case, or 256 in general.
# and also we can keep an mapping using ord().
# We can then get the key using ord('ch') - ord('a')
# Ordering is important in Trie.
