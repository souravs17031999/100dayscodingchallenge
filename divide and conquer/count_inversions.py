# Program for computing count of all inversions of array - inversions are all such pairs (i, j) s.t. i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]
# IDEA: Logic is to compute on idea of merge sort algorithm, we can observe merge sort inherently compares both the subarrays divided recursively,
# and so, we can count of inversion while merging the arrays
# What we do is we recursively try to divide the array until only one element is left, where inversion is 0 (base case), and then merge it and count the
# inversions while merging.
# In this way, we are dividing, conquering and then combining our solutions to the overall problem.
# TIME : 0(n*lg(n)), SPACE : 0(n)
